#### Experiment 6

In the Spring boot MVC experiment I once again (as in expass 5) got some issues with ``.gitignore``, even though I 
run ``git rm --cached -r .idea`` and committed the `.gitignore` file once again it would not 
ignore the mvn files or the .idea folder. 

Otherwise I had no problems, I updated npm using homebrew and the tutorials were okay to follow.
