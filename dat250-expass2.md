##### Installing Derby: 

I installed Derby using the manual, but encountered some problems. At first I did not install it in the `/opt/` folder
because I did not think it was specified to be in the opt folder for a reason. Later in the installation
I got a message that the path was wrong. I later found out that the opt folder is used for holding independent software, 
so I decided to move the derby folder to `usr/local/opt` which is the opt folder in mac.
